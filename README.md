# Using Delta Live Tables, Unity Catalog, and Query Federation

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use Delta Live Tables, Unity Catalog, and Query Federation in Databricks to create a star schema.
Delta Live Tables (DLT) provide an automated, reliable framework for building data pipelines.
Unity Catalog offers a unified governance solution for managing data and AI assets in Databricks.
Query Federation allows you to access and query data across different data sources without the need to move or replicate data.
The key components and functionalities of this project includes:
- Planning Data Model
- Databricks Setup
- Query Federation & Modelling
- Visualisation via Microsoft PowerBI

## Planning Data Model
To ensure a robust design, I used draw.io to plan out the physical data model of the star schema. Based on this model, I then created dummy data and visualized it in Power BI to generate preliminary insights, showcasing what the final solution would roughly look like.
